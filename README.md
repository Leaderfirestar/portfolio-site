# Portfolio Site

My portfolio site is written with Nextjs and Typescript with my [Portfolio-Api](https://github.com/Leaderfirestar/portfolio-api) using strapi as a cms. It is configured to use a REST api to serve my data. This repository is meant to showcase some of my projects and my resume. I love writing code, and by extension, a good challenge. If given a design, I can style a page, though when left to my own devices (like on this site), I stick to pretty simple styles. It works for Google, right?
